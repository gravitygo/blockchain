# 📚⛓️ SkillChain - Web3 NFT Verification Project

This project includes smart contracts for issuing NFTs and a frontend for verifying ownership and metadata.

## 💡 Concept

A **decentralized platform for verifying skills and certifications** on the blockchain. It aims to provide gig workers, freelancers, and employers with a trustless way to verify credentials, reducing fraud and increase credibility.
